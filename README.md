# Project Surfboard
Currently cannot compile due to losing the dependency libraries, but the source code is given here. A youtube video of the demo is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URfbNKD8HmU)

This was an interesting project, our professor making us do most everything from scratch (down to the projection matricies!) made for a huge learning experience. Kinematic animations, reflections, stencil buffer, noise, soft shadows, and more. Adding to that learning Git for version control, it was very fun :)

This was completed my sophomore year with classmate Michael Wollard.
